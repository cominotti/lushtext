# gtk-lush-widgets

`gtk-lush-widgets` is a `0.0.0` GTK Lush family crate for small reusable GTK
widgets and render-hold helpers.

## Internal Platform Status

This is a functional in-tree `0.0.0` implementation for LushText's internal
platform. It is not a stable external dependency and is not a crates.io release
candidate. The current API exists so LushText can keep geometry and render-hold
helpers small, local, and reviewable.

Follow the current posture in `docs/next/gtk-lush.md`. Baseline adoption
evidence for this crate is tracked in `docs/gtk-lush-adoption/`.

## Scope

`ClipBin` is a single-child widget that reports zero minimum size while still
delegating natural size to its child and clipping snapshots to its allocation.

`RenderHoldOverlay` captures already-rendered child pixels into a non-targetable
cover picture, hides the live child, lets callers warm the live child beneath
the cover, and clears the cover with paired opacity restoration.

The crate does not schedule reflow timing, own readiness predicates, or encode
application-specific minimap behavior.
