## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Mutation Testing Configuration
The project SHALL provide checked-in mutation-testing configuration that defines the default mutation scope, exclusions, and test runner for deterministic LushText logic. The scope SHALL identify pure decision logic by naming convention rather than by hand-listed file paths, so that pure policy keeps mutation coverage wherever its owning workflow lives.

#### Scenario: Default scope targets deterministic logic
- **WHEN** a developer runs the standard mutation command without extra file filters
- **THEN** mutation testing examines model code, service code, and pure policy modules identified by the workflow policy naming convention, rather than broad GTK widget adapters or packaging scripts

#### Scenario: Pure policy is in scope wherever it lives
- **WHEN** a workflow's pure decision logic lives in a `policy.rs` module inside a UI workflow directory
- **THEN** the default mutation scope examines it through the naming convention
- **AND** no hand-listed file path is required to include it

#### Scenario: GTK adapters stay out of scope without hand-listed method exclusions
- **WHEN** a workflow's pure policy is separated from its GTK adapter by module
- **THEN** the adapter is out of scope because it is not a policy module
- **AND** the configuration does not need `exclude_re` entries enumerating adapter method names

#### Scenario: Exclusions are narrow and documented
- **WHEN** a mutant, function, or file is excluded from the default mutation scope
- **THEN** the exclusion MUST be as narrow as practical and MUST include a nearby reason explaining why it is equivalent, uninteresting, generated, or outside the supported mutation lane

### Requirement: Widget Harness Boundary
The project SHALL keep compositor-driven widget behavior outside the first blocking mutation-testing scope.

#### Scenario: GTK adapter code needs stronger mutation coverage
- **WHEN** mutation testing reveals that important behavior lives only inside GTK adapter code
- **THEN** the implementation MUST either extract deterministic decision logic into model, service, or workflow policy modules that can be covered by non-widget mutation testing, or document why the behavior must remain widget-only

#### Scenario: Extraction target may be the owning workflow
- **WHEN** deterministic decision logic is extracted out of a GTK adapter for mutation coverage
- **THEN** it MAY be placed in that workflow's pure policy module instead of being hoisted into `model/`
- **AND** it MUST remain free of GTK-family imports

#### Scenario: Widget mutation experiment is added later
- **WHEN** a future implementation adds mutation testing that directly exercises the widget harness
- **THEN** it MUST preserve the existing `scripts/run-widget-tests.sh` responsibilities for Mutter, D-Bus, renderer settings, retries, and warning filtering

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Policy relocation requires mutation parity evidence

When pure policy relocates between directories, the change SHALL demonstrate that
mutation coverage is unchanged. The evidence MUST show that the relocated logic
still generates mutants and that those mutants are still killed. A relocation whose
mutants are no longer generated MUST be treated as a coverage regression, not as an
acceptable consequence of the move.

#### Scenario: Relocation reports parity

- **WHEN** a change relocates pure policy
- **THEN** it records mutation results for the relocated logic before and after the
  move
- **AND** the counts of generated and killed mutants for that logic are unchanged

#### Scenario: Lost mutants block the relocation

- **WHEN** relocation causes the policy's mutants to fall outside the default scope
- **THEN** the change is incomplete until the scope convention or the module
  placement is corrected
- **AND** the loss MUST NOT be recorded as accepted debt

#### Scenario: Policy module outside scope reach fails policy checks

- **WHEN** a pure policy module exists at a path the default mutation scope cannot
  reach
- **THEN** `make check-policy` fails
- **AND** the failure names the unreachable module
