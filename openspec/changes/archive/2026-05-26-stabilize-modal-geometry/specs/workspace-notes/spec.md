## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Workspace-note editor mode switching is layout-stable
The system SHALL keep the shared workspace-note editor popup visually stable when switching between Edit and Render. The edit and rendered note surfaces MUST keep matching text-origin padding so the same plain note content does not shift horizontally or vertically when changing modes. The popup MUST keep the same outer size with no visible shrink or expansion, including when the note starts empty and the user types before the first Render switch.

#### Scenario: Switch a workspace note from Edit to Render
- **WHEN** the user opens a workspace-note editing popup and switches from Edit to Render
- **THEN** the popup keeps the same outer size
- **AND** the rendered text starts at the same visual origin as the editable text

#### Scenario: Switch a newly typed workspace note from Edit to Render
- **WHEN** the user opens an initially empty workspace-note editing popup
- **AND** the user types note text in Edit mode
- **AND** the user switches to Render for the first time
- **THEN** the popup keeps the same outer size with no visible shrink or expansion
- **AND** the rendered text starts at the same visual origin as the editable text
